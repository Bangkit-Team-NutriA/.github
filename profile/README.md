## nutriA
*CEK NUTRISI HANYA SEUJUNG JARI*   
<br>
our project name is nutri-A with tagline "cek nutrisi hanya seujung jari", in this application we have 3 main features which are:
- food image classification and give nutrient information which are fat, protein, carbo and also energy/calories (in this feature we use deep learning).
- second feature, meal recommendation , so we scrape data from [panganku.org](panganku.org) and we search an optimum combination of meal for nutrient that user need (we use genetic algorithm).
- the last one, recipe recommendation, we scrape data from [fatsecret.co.id](fatsecret.co.id) and recommend recipe based on ingredients that user input and give nutrient information as well (we use closest distance).
