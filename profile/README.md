# Bangkit 2022 C22-PS014 Product Capstone
## nutriA
*CEK NUTRISI HANYA SEUJUNG JARI*   
<br>
our project name is nutri-A with tagline "cek nutrisi hanya seujung jari", in this application we have 3 main features which are:
- Food image classification and give nutrient information which are fat, protein, carbo and also energy/calories (in this feature we use deep learning).
- Meal recommendation , so we scrape data from [panganku.org](https://www.panganku.org) and we search an optimum combination of meal for nutrient that user need (we use genetic algorithm).
- Recipe recommendation, we scrape data from [fatsecret.co.id](https://www.fatsecret.co.id) and recommend recipe based on ingredients that user input and give nutrient information as well (we use closest distance).

## here is our documentation and step to replicate our steP :
1. Determine the flow of applications and the MVP feature
2. Find dataset 
3. Train the dataset using transfer learning and doing hyperparameter tuning like epochs number, do augmentation and fine tuning as well
4. Analysis the model that give the best performance
5. Convert to TFJS
6. Create an API
7. Create Cloud SQL : 1 Instance
8. Create Virtual Machine using Google Compute Engine : 2 Instances
9. Create Load Balancer
10. Create layout in android
11. Create Retrofit to connect to API
12. Continuously upgrade
